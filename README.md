# Testing

This repository contains a simple Pygame project. From the main menu you can:

- Press **ENTER** to start the game.
- Press **J** to launch joystick calibration if a joystick is connected.
- Use **M** to toggle music and **ESC** to exit.

The `Game` class also provides a `set_portrait_fullscreen()` method that
switches the window to a portrait-oriented fullscreen mode.
