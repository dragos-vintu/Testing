# Testing

This repository contains a simple Pygame project. From the main menu you can:

- Press **ENTER** to start the game.
- Press **J** to launch joystick calibration if a joystick is connected.
- Press **ESC** to exit.

Each level is worth **5,000** points. Your progress toward this total is
displayed during gameplay as "Level Score" in the upper-left corner.

The `Game` class also provides a `set_portrait_fullscreen()` method that
switches the window to a portrait-oriented fullscreen mode.
